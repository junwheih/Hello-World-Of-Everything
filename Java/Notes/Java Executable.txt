How to make Java file executable

1) Create a *.java file. Example: MC.java
2) Go to CMD and compile it. Make sure you are at the right directory.
3) Type javac MC.java ---> Know that MC is just an example.
4) After compiled it, you will now have a *.class ---> the * is your class name.
5) Create a new text file named: manifest.txt  ---> MUST BE manifest.txt
6) In the text file, TYPE: Main-Class: MC ---> MC is your class name.
7) Go to CMD, Type: jar cfm MC.jar manifest.txt MC.class ---> Only manifest is the same, 'MC' must be changed accordingly
	---> cvmf, cmvf as the cfm also can.
	
	// cvmf = <create a new jar file> <manifest.txt> <YourClass File>
	// cmvf = <manifest.txt> <create a new jar file> <YourClass File>
	// jar cfm <create a new jar file> <manifest.txt> <YourClass File>

	// c = compile
	// v = variable || new jar file
	// m = manifest.txt
	// f = class file 
8) Success.

How to compile multiple classes.
I)   javac *.java  
II)  java <the main class name>   
III) In manifest.txt ---> Still the main class name.

NOTE: For multiple class compilation together, you need to use CMD.

Notepad++ can too. COMMAND: cmd /K javac "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"\*.java && cd $(CURRENT_DIRECTORY) && java $(NAME_PART) ---> It should be the main class. When you compile, your page should be on the main class.

TYPE: java -cp <file>.jar <Main Class name>
TYPE: java -jar <file>.jar

** The MC actually stands for Minecraft. You have to change according to your file name.

You can run it with double clicks or run with command which is...
1) Enter CMD and go to your directory
2) TYPE: java -jar MC.jar
3) TYPE: java -cp MC.jar MC <--- MC is the Class name
