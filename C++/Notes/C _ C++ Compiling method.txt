C++ & C Programming | Setting Up System Variable

1) Windows Key + Pause|Break to go to the System Properties
2) Advance Tab; Environment Variable;
3) Choose System variable or user variable tab also can. (Recommend using System Variable)
4) **Add 'PATH' to one of them by clicking the 'NEW' if you do not find any of them.
5) Before editing if you ald have the path, make sure you type ';', means not stick together.
	eg. %System Root% ; <--- Add right here. And then add the bin directory.
	eg. %System Root% ; C:/Mingw32/bin <--- depends on your installation directory.
6) Click ok, then go to cmd.
7) Type either one, g++ -v, or gcc -v
8) If a bunch of words pop out which mean you have the variable ald;

How to compile the *.c or *.cpp files?
1) Go to cmd
2) g++ -o <application name> <file that you want to compile>
	note: -o means compile. '<>' <--- The arrows do not include
	note: application name does not need *.exe behind. For example, you created a MINECRAFT, then just type
			g++ -o Minecraft minecraft.cpp  <---BOTH WORK!
			g++ -o Minecraft minecraft.c    <---BOTH WORK!
Wonder whether this work? ---> gcc -o Minecraft minecraft.cpp (Work for C Programming Only!!! :d)
			g++ <application name> -o <files name> (NOT WORKING!!! :d)

3) Running the application, after you compiled it, simply type <application name>.exe <--- must have .exe behind.
	note: <application name> can be any thing, '<>' do not include! 
	
SUCESS! :)
